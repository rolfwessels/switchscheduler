Switch Scheduler
===============

Remotely schedule a switch to go on and off

The Idea
============
The idea is to have a web server host some scheduling setting. Then I would have an arduino with a wifly connected poll for new setting every 10 minutes. Based on the schedule I want to switch 1 or more switches on and off.

The story
==============
Initially I wanted this schedule to run for my geyser. Obviously a geyser pulls a lot of current and I was scared to tinker with a relay, so the plan was to switch it on and off using a servo and a little printed part. This would work on a normal switch but unfortunately this switch requires too much force for my servo.

Next would be to do it the right way using a relay. I went to my local electronic shop and picked up a hf18ff relay. It is a 12v relay and the arduino pins only push out 5v so I need to up the voltage somehow.

Missing bits
=============

- Develop the scheduling server
- Updating fritzing file
- Togle the 12v relay
- Installing the relay
- Create instructable
- Store schedule file on sd card for offline scheduling
